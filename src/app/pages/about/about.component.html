      <h3>- How typing speed is calculated?</h3>
      <p>
        Typing speed is calculated by dividing the total number of correctly
        typed characters by 4, which represents the average word length in
        English. This approach helps to minimize the impact of random factors
        caused by varying word lengths. By focusing on characters rather than
        words, we obtain a more precise measurement of typing speed.
